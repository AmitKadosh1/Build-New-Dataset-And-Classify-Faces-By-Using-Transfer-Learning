## Introduction
Face classification is an important capability that can have a wide variety of uses. for example:
1. The system can be used to help blind people know who is at the front door of the house.
2. The system can also be integrated into the smart home field - automatic opening of the house door or simply reading the name of the person standing at the entrance to the house.
3. Creating personal albums - you can locate the photos in which a certain person appears and thus build a personal album for him easily.
This area was not tested due to the lack of a suitable dataset.
In addition, face classification is an individual problem of each person because each person knows different people and wants to classify them.
Therefore, we found it appropriate to prove the feasibility of implementing a system based on Deep Learning for the purpose of face classification for a group of people on which the model will be trusted.
The main difficulty expected in this project is that Deep Learning works well when there are many examples and in this project the number of examples is very few.
In order to overcome this difficulty, we will use transfer learning which was trained on another dataset for a different purpose.



## Dataset
The name Original Dataset represents the original images loaded into the array before any processing.
The dataset for our project should contain images of some persons with different characteristics (for example, different situation, different lighting, different camera and more). There is no Dataset like this around the internet so we had to build it.
In order for this project to be able after further hardware development to be used by anyone, we need to require a relatively low minimum threshold of images for each person. Therefore, we chose to use 50 images for each person.
We built the dataset for this project from images from our personal smartphones and social networks. We collect data of 15 classes (different people) with each having only 50 images.
We will save the images in a folder called "Original Dataset" which contains 15 folders for each of the people we want to teach our model.
